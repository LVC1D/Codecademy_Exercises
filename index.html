            <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
            <p>HTML is a declarative language; tells the computer what to do, without specifying the details of how exactly to do a certain action.
                HTML's code is based on elements, structured in a top-to-right, top-to-bottom manner, without anything fancy going on.
                The fancy stuff comes into play when we add <em>CSS</em> (more on that later).
            </p>

                    <h3>Is HTML hard to write in?</h3>
                        <p>HTML is one of those languages that some people consider a real coding language, and other - not so much. In my personal opinion, 
                        since elements are executable, and that semantics exist in writing out the code properly - that's a coding language in my books.
                        However, keep in mind that no website or web app would exist without HTML. At all!

            <h2>What elements?</h2>
            <p>HTML,as we discussed just recently, is consisted of elements. It's important to understand what each part of the elements stands for what.
                Elements consists of Opening tags and Closing tags tha surround the content of the element. 
                Note: some of the tags are self-closing (such as &lt;link&gt;, &lt;meta&gt; and &lt;img&gt;,)
            </p>
                <h3>What the Tables?!</h3>
                    <p>The below table will show the difference between non-sematic elements and semantic ones. 
                        In most cases, you would want to opt for semantic tags as those are more accessibility and SEO-friendly.
                        The only exception you would opt for non-sematics elements is if you ened to assign them particular classes, or ID's, to style them accordingly.
                    </p>
                <div class="semantics">
                    <table>

            <h2>How do you CSS?</h2>
            <p>CSS is a natural "spouse" of HTML that is responsible for making sure the whole webpage doesn't look bland and boring.
                This normally involves a bunch of aspects, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changing typefaces and anything related to it</li>
                <li>Adjusting colors of the element (and their background)</li>
                <li>Positioning elements in a way that is outside of the typical HTML flow</li>
                <li>and much more!...</li>
            </ul>
